Cancelled the trip as owner since it is the fault of the H. Advised him that the trip has been cancelled.

Check reservation and check listing;   H said he changed and opted out to automatic pricing 5 days ago; and change the vehicle's rate per day to $400. The trip was booked 2 hours ago but still follow the previous price of the car showing on the calendar which is $300.   Advise H that after H change the pricing of the vehicle it will still follow the original price of the car on the calendar so H needs to adjust the price on the calendar as well. H said that is not true because; H said that he snoozed the vehicle and when H made the car available 5 days ago and change the day rate; it followed the original price of the car. As per H with his experience in Turo for a long time;   H insists that when H changes the price of the vehicle it will automatically change the calendar price as well. It should be sync with each other. H said sets up the vehicle prices ever since using his other account Driver 286451 - Jeff Turner.   H said that this happened as well before due to someone from Turo adjusted the price and insurance of the vehicle and logged in to his account.   Advised H that will investigate what happened but H need to still adjust the calendar pricing of the car for it to be similar to the vehicle's pricing. Ask H if H can accommodate the upcoming trip; H is not sure; H said he will coordinate with G and told G the problem if G won't continue the trip due to the car's rate needs to be $400 per day. H requested to cancel with our any penalties for him since the error came from Turo about pricing settings and not H's fault.   Advise H that will reach out to G about it and endorse G to our dedicated specialist. Wait for G and H's response then move to cancellations if necessary   ZD4165149"},{"reservation_id":"3749064","owner_name":"Joshua Dimand","owner_email":"josh.dimand@gmail.com","owner_phone_number":"18082948097","renter_name":"Joo-Hye Park","renter_email":"jcpark86@gmail.com","renter_phone_number":"14088579190","current_start_ts_local":"12/21/18 9:00:00 PM","current_end_ts_local":"12/26/18 12:00:00 PM","vehicle":"Jeep -

The car was restricted automatically on the safety ticket in ZD #4108050. Added $25 TC to the G and didn't cancel any upcoming trips since there an in-progress trip in Reservation 4148240; and no issues reported on the on-going trip. Also; I didn't add any warnings notes yet to the H since the G mentioned the issues after the trip ends and after the reimbursement (miles and gas) was filed by the H.

Trip ended Feb 7; 2019 10:29 AM PST. Solution: Unpublished. || H ci reported that the G is not yet in the pickup location. Asked H what time he arrived in the PU and said that it's his residence. H stated that the G informed him that he'll be there at 9:30 and also indicated in the messaging app. H can no longer wait because he has work and already late but still willing to provide the vehicle at 12 NN sharp as he's not willing to wait for another 45 minutes. OBC to G multiple times and the phone is just kept on ringing. Went back to H line and advised that I'll send the G an email about the condition but he changed his mind and said that he can't go back anymore because he has a lot of projects. Advised that the trip needs to be cancelled and will receive the full earnings. Ended the trip and refunded the G's protection fee instead of 1 day because the trip is only for a day. Selected the Host how does Turo work category in macro as it is the nearest from Guest cancellation from now and there's no Guest cancellation categorization in my macro.

I issued a refund of $90.58. When going to place my notes; I saw that the G had to have a manual extension and would need to pay $90.58; the price I just refunded. Appears after the manual extension the G had an unpaid balance and when they went to extend again; they paid for the Dec 8th extension as well as the Dec 16th in one large sum; which explains the charge appearing to be doubled. As I have already refunded the G cannot recharge them for my mishap. || ZD #3758135  Problem: cx call in has a trip in progress he was overcharged and he has the same car the rate was higher.

Educated H the Valets main job is to hand off cars and that we always advise H's to take their pown docs if they can. || escalating case as per supervisor approval- Host is calling to request smoking fee with evidence //based on record 360 guests pass the smoking smell but on the video it looks like there are ashes///host said that the vehicle had the windows down and it didn't see at the pick up time but if he has the window up it has a strong smell  ZD#3956059"},{"reservation_id":"3884466","owner_name":"Josh Zerlan","owner_email":"kcturo@gmail.com","owner_phone_number":"18168009181","renter_name":"Jarod Rogers","renter_email":"rogers_jarod@yahoo.com","renter_phone_number":"19136899790","current_start_ts_local":"11/24/18 12:00:00 PM","current_end_ts_local":"11/26/18 10:00:00 PM","vehicle":"Toyota - C-HR - 2019","is_deposit":"0","is_claim":"0","is_damage_invoice":"0","conversation_id":"3463691","disputed_reimbursement_id":"","other_reimbursement_id":"","vehicle_id":"511626","notes":""},{"reservation_id":"4287611","owner_name":"Joshua Hapairai-Hansen","owner_email":"joshua.hapairai.hansen@gmail.com","owner_phone_number":"18014103737","renter_name":"Missi Todd","renter_email":"miss.e.todd@gmail.com","renter_phone_number":"19062824899","current_start_ts_local":"3/17/19 5:00:00 PM","current_end_ts_local":"3/25/19 7:30:00 AM","vehicle":"Volkswagen - Passat - 2017","is_deposit":"0","is_claim":"0","is_damage_invoice":"0","conversation_id":"3806474","disputed_reimbursement_id":"","other_reimbursement_id":"","vehicle_id":"505664","notes":""},{"reservation_id":"3765649","owner_name":"Josh Ramsey","owner_email":"joshramsey21@yahoo.com","owner_phone_number":"18652921613","renter_name":"Wesley Hurst","renter_email":"wesley.hurst@comcast.net","renter_phone_number":"16155098934","current_start_ts_local":"10/27/18 5:30:00 AM","current_end_ts_local":"10/31/18 6:30:00 PM","vehicle":"Jaguar - XF - 2009","is_deposit":"0","is_claim":"0","is_damage_invoice":"0","conversation_id":"3358347","disputed_reimbursement_id":"","other_reimbursement_id":"","vehicle_id":"436787","notes":""},{"reservation_id":"3536915","owner_name":"Joshua Stock","owner_email":"everydaydriversaz@gmail.com","owner_phone_number":"14803894572","renter_name":"Matthew Hines","renter_email":"matt_hines@live.com","renter_phone_number":"18473610187","current_start_ts_local":"9/19/18 5:00:00 PM","current_end_ts_local":"9/21/18 4:30:00 PM","vehicle":"Lexus - IS 350 - 2006","is_deposit":"0","is_claim":"0","is_damage_invoice":"0","conversation_id":"3155896","disputed_reimbursement_id":"","other_reimbursement_id":"","vehicle_id":"481145","notes":""},{"reservation_id":"3563615","owner_name":"Joshua Fuller","owner_email":"joshuaf1088@yahoo.com","owner_phone_number":"19194976978","renter_name":"Daniel Zynn","renter_email":"dvzynn@gmail.com","renter_phone_number":"13107296210","current_start_ts_local":"9/20/18 6:00:00 PM","current_end_ts_local":"9/24/18 10:00:00 AM","vehicle":"Jeep - Cherokee - 2017","is_deposit":"0","is_claim":"0","is_damage_invoice":"0","conversation_id":"3179822","disputed_reimbursement_id":"","other_reimbursement_id":"273854","vehicle_id":"387863","notes":""},{"reservation_id":"4149755","owner_name":"Josh Chen","owner_email":"joshnchen@hotmail.com","owner_phone_number":"15099909009","renter_name":"Thomas Heyder","renter_email":"thomasheyder@yahoo.de","renter_phone_number":"4.9173E+11","current_start_ts_local":"2/7/19 3:00:00 PM","current_end_ts_local":"2/16/19 3:00:00 PM","vehicle":"Dodge - Ram  50 - 1984","is_deposit":"0","is_claim":"0","is_damage_invoice":"0","conversation_id":"3689573","disputed_reimbursement_id":"","other_reimbursement_id":"","vehicle_id":"480098","notes":""},{"reservation_id":"3842424","owner_name":"Josh Adamson","owner_email":"purpleboy50@gmail.com","owner_phone_number":"18015738397","renter_name":"Kayla Torriente","renter_email":"familybre6@gmail.com","renter_phone_number":"18018848641","current_start_ts_local":"11/15/18 2:00:00 PM","current_end_ts_local":"12/3/18 2:00:00 PM","vehicle":"Subaru - Outback - 2008","is_deposit":"0","is_claim":"0","is_damage_invoice":"0","conversation_id":"3426148","disputed_reimbursement_id":"","other_reimbursement_id":"","vehicle_id":"376817","notes":""},{"reservation_id":"3762525","owner_name":"Josh Watts","owner_email":"joshua.watts11@gmail.com","owner_phone_number":"12629516415","renter_name":"Hussain Laghabi","renter_email":"hlaghabi@gmail.com","renter_phone_number":"15743185869","current_start_ts_local":"10/26/18 5:00:00 PM","current_end_ts_local":"10/29/18 6:00:00 PM","vehicle":"Mazda - CX-5 - 2014","is_deposit":"1","is_claim":"0","is_damage_invoice":"0","conversation_id":"3355655","disputed_reimbursement_id":"","other_reimbursement_id":"","vehicle_id":"498841","notes":"G called in since H has not responded to his messages.

He would like to report the Late Return to be compensated as the truck should've been returned last night at 7 PM. Unfortunately; the issue has been escalated to the SF yesterday as the guest got stuck up at the Topeka train station due to blizzard and the highway was not passable. So Logan from the Escalations Team took the case and was advised the G to leave the car at the Topeka train station with the keys. Logan offered that we can just tow the vehicle from the train station to deliver it back to the host location due to a natural disaster. However; there was no Job ID created for the towing. So since the Escalations Team already approved the towing; I contacted the Swoop and I'm the one who requested for the towing. I provided all of the information and I was able to speak with the guest; Pamela. As per Pamela; the truck was left in front of 500 SE Holliday St; Topeka; KS 66607 Topeka train station.  Job ID: 931910 was created to pick up the vehicle from Topeka and be delivered to the drop off location at 1124 Howell Street; Kansas City; MO 64116.  Related tickets : (H) ZD #3653339 | (G) ZD #3652450 || H called in TO follow uP for his vehicle as it was not returned due to blizzard. Upon checking; this was handled by SF. Advised that we will contact the G to determine the specific location of the vehicle so we can dispatch a towing.

Informed H that he will not be charged for the towing service.  hzd#3653339 gzd#3653488 || H ci to inquire about the situation of G and his car. As per H G received the call saying this G asking where to leave the car due to the G can't go to the drop off location due to bad weather(Blizzard). The call was escalated to SF but SD was not able to create RA ticket for the car to be towed Check this ZD#3652450 where in SF advised G to just leave the car at Topeka Amtrak station so that we can dispatch a tow truck to retrieve the vehicle and bring it back to the host at no cost to G. AS per Lead Jian/Lester since no dispatch was created. Transfer to EQ to create RA for Towing. Transfer to EQ   ZD#3653339 || After speaking with my colleagues; advised to G that the best option in this case is going to be for the G to leave the vehicle at the Topeka Amtrak station where they will be catching their train (originally G was supposed to catch the train in Kansas City; but all roads are close due to a blizzard) and we will send a tow truck to retrieve the vehicle and bring it back to the H. Unsure of whether or not the tow truck will be able to bring the vehicle back to the H's location since the roads are closed; but reservation ends in 2 hours. Advised to G that they will not have to pay anything and we will cover costs to tow the vehicle back to the H.  Advised G to take photos of the inside and outside of the vehicle & where G leaves the vehicle parked. Advised probably best option is going to be to leave the keys in a hidden place on the vehicle or with the attendant at the Amtrak station. ZD#3652450 || ZD#3652450 G ci to ask where he can leave the vehicle because the way to Kansas City is already closed due to Blizzard.

I told them that was fine but I lived 20 minutes away from the airport. He refused to meet me at the gas station or even park it in the economy parking lot right next to the terminal. So long story short my truck ended up being left with nobody in it off 4 hours early in the drop off area of the airport. I was lucky my brother was at the airport dropping off his car so he could get it before they towed it off.

Used the cancellation tool; the location is UNLIKELY. Since this is the H's first trip ever; I removed the listing from the Book Instantly and placed the H no show hold. I offered the replacement car to the G with this Vehicle 480138 - 2016 Infiniti QX70 but she refused to have it because she really wanted to have a BMW vehicle. She found this Vehicle 321594 - 2014 BMW Z4 but when I tried calling the owner; she's not answering. So the G decided to book this car tomorrow instead to have time to reach the owner of the car.
